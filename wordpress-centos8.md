# WordPress Auto Installation Script for CentOS 8
* Install a **minimal** *Centos 8* installation
* SSH to the server as `root` (e.g. with Putty)
* If you want to run with default parametersm just type or copy-and-paste:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UncleDan/linux-scripts/master/wordpress-centos8.sh|sh ; exit
```
* If you wanto to adjust parameters to your needs use:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UncleDan/linux-scripts/master/wordpress-centos8.sh --output wordpress-centos8.sh
vi wordpress-centos8.sh
sh wordpress-centos8.sh
```

* Thats' pretty much all.
